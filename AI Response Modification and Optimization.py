"""
Project Title: Bias Mitigation & Token Limit Optimization

Challenge Overview:
This project explores how AI models handle biases and operate within token limits. It includes two key activities:

1. Bias Mitigation:
   - Identify and reduce bias in AI responses.
   - Craft neutral prompts to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.
   - Reflect on how prompt phrasing influences bias and inclusivity.

2. Token Limit Optimization:
   - Understand how token limits affect AI output.
   - Condense long prompts while preserving core meaning.
   - Compare responses to long vs. short prompts and reflect on detail retention.

Project Goals:
- Deepen understanding of prompt engineering.
- Improve AI output quality through thoughtful prompt design.
- Learn how to balance clarity, specificity, and brevity.

Folder Setup:
- Create a folder named 'AI_Prompt_Tuning'
- Inside it, add:
    - 'scripts/' for Python files
    - 'activity_results/' for reflections and outputs

Submission:
- Use VS Code to organize and run your project.
- Push to GitHub and submit the repository link via your Codingal dashboard.
